<p>Data structures and algorithms are fundamental concepts in computer science that deal with the organization and manipulation of data.</p>
<p>A data structure is a way of storing and organizing data in a computer program so that it can be accessed and used efficiently. Some common data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.</p>
<p>An algorithm is a set of instructions or procedures that a computer follows to solve a problem or perform a task. Algorithms are used to manipulate data in various ways, such as searching for specific information, sorting data, or performing mathematical operations.</p>
<p>Together, data structures and algorithms are essential tools for designing efficient and effective computer programs. By understanding how to choose the right data structure and algorithm for a specific task, developers can optimize the performance of their programs and improve their ability to handle large amounts of data.</p>
