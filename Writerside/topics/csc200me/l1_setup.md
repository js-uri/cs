# CSC 200 ME : Lab 1 | Set Up

## Objectives

- Ensure students can set up a development environment for Python 3.12 on both Windows and macOS.
- Familiarize students with two popular Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), PyCharm and Visual Studio Code.
- Validate that students understand the importance of having a functional development environment for coding in Python.

## Relevance

Understanding how to set up and work with IDEs is crucial in the real world because:

- In science and engineering, Python is widely used for data analysis, simulations, and various computational tasks. A well-configured IDE streamlines the coding process.
- IDEs like PyCharm and Visual Studio Code are industry-standard tools, and proficiency with them is highly beneficial in software development and data science roles.
- The ability to independently set up and configure development environments is an essential skill for any computer scientist or engineer.

## Instructions and Guidelines

<!-- TODO : Rewrite all this -->
Provide students with a clear set of instructions and guidelines:
Include screenshots, code snippets, or video tutorials to illustrate each step.
Emphasize the importance of careful reading and following instructions, as this is a fundamental skill in programming.

### Install Python

1) Visit python.org and download Python 3.12
    1) For WindowsOS, you may want to follow along with the video to select all the necessary options during setup https://youtu.be/nU2Egc3Zx3Q?feature=shared
2) Test if Python was install correctly. Open a terminal [MacOS] / PowerShell [WindowsOS] and type: `python --version`
    1) If installed correctly, the following with the version installed should come up: `Python #.#.#`

### Install an IDE
