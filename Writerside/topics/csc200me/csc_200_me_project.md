# Research Project

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide students with an opportunity to apply the concepts and skills they have learned in the course to a real-world problem. The project will require students to work in teams to design and implement a programmatic solution to a problem of their choosing. The project will culminate in a final presentation and demonstration of the software solution.

## Objectives

Upon successful completion of this project, students will be able to:

- Demonstrate the ability to 
  - design and implement a software solution
  - present and demonstrate a software solution
  - work effectively in a team
  - apply the concepts and skills learned in the course

## Your Task

Create a group of 3-4 members and consider a real-world problem that you would like to solve or a game you would like to create. You will take the remaining time for the term (through week 14) to complete this project.

## Deliverables

- A programmatic solution to a real-world problem
- A final presentation and demonstration of the software solution
- A final report documenting the software solution

### Programmatic Solution

The programmatic solution should be a software application that solves a real-world problem. The idea is to use what you've learned throughout the term and apply it in a meaningful way. The requirement for this solution is that you must use at least 80% of the material you have learned in the course. This means based on the subject-matter covered, you need to apply at least 80% of all topics from the term. Example, looping: I am asking for you to show me the proper use of a looping mechanism. This does not mean you must use a `for` loop and a `while` loop in your solution. It simply means you would need to implement at least one or the other in your solution. 

#### Requirements

Solution must implement aspects covered in the course, such as:

- Variables
- Data Types
- Operators
- Control Structures
  - Looping
  - Conditional
- Functions
  - Parameters
  - Return Values
- Collection(s)
  - Lists/Arrays/Vectors (language dependent)
- Strings
- Structures
- Classes
- Exception Handling

### Final Presentation and Demonstration

The final presentation and demonstration will be a live event during our final lab window. Each team will have 10 minutes to present and demonstrate their software solution. The presentation should include a brief overview of the problem, the software solution, and a demonstration of the software solution. The presentation should be engaging and informative, and should clearly communicate the problem, the software solution, and the team's approach to solving the problem.

Tips for a successful presentation:

- Be prepared
- Be organized
- Be engaging
- Be informative
- Be professional

Your presentation should be a chance to show off what you've achieved as well as to demonstrate your understanding of the problem and the solution. You can choose the format of your presentation too. Recommended for clarity is a brief introduction to the problem or rules to the game you chose to implement. Discuss an outline of the solution and then demonstrate the solution.

### Final Report

The final report should document the software solution, including the problem, the solution details, and the team's approach to solving the problem. The report should be well-written and well-organized, and should clearly communicate the problem, the software solution, and the team's approach to solving the problem. Include all references and resources used in the creation of the solution. The final report should be in the form of a well-formatted, Markdown document. https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/

For clarity in the report, you may want to include code snippets from your implementation to help explain how you came about your solution.

All resources used to complete the project must be cited at the end of the report.

## Evaluation

The project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- The quality of the software solution
  - Does it solve the problem?
  - Does it demonstrate the team's understanding of the problem and the solution?
  - Does it demonstrate the team's ability to apply the concepts and skills learned in the course?
  - Does it demonstrate the team's ability to work effectively in a team?
- The quality of the final presentation and demonstration
  - Does it clearly communicate the problem, the software solution, and the team's approach to solving the problem?
  - Is it engaging and informative?
  - Does it demonstrate the team's understanding of the problem and the solution?
- The quality of the final report
  - Does it clearly communicate the problem, the software solution, and the team's approach to solving the problem?
  - Is it well-written and well-organized?
  - Does it demonstrate the team's understanding of the problem and the solution?

## Timeline

The project is due before lab week 14 at which time we will hold live presentations of your work during our final lab window.
