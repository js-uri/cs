### Course Policies

<procedure style="choices">
<b>Submissions</b>
<step>All submissions will be handled through Gradescope</step>
<step>Missed deliverables cannot be made up</step>
<step>Extensions will be handled on an individual basis, but are typically reserved for special cases. Contact me as soon as possible if any extraneous circumstances arise.</step>
</procedure>

<procedure style="choices">
<b>Attendance</b>
<step>While there is no formal, in-person lecture, you should be interacting with the asynchronous lecture material in the schedule</step>
<step>The weekly quiz will be used as a method of recording attendance for the week.</step>
</procedure>

<procedure style="choices">
<b>Academic Integrity &amp; AI Assistance</b>
<step>You may use Al programs e.g. ChatGPT to help generate ideas and brainstorm. However, you should note that the material generated by these programs may be inaccurate, incomplete, or otherwise problematic. Beware that use may also stifle your own independent thinking and creativity.</step>
<step>You may not submit any work generated by an Al program as your own. If you include material generated by an Al program, it should be cited like any other reference material (with due consideration for the quality of the reference, which may be poor).</step>
<step>Any plagiarism or other form of cheating will be dealt with severely under relevant URI policies.</step>
</procedure>

### University Policies

<procedure>
<b>Disability, Access, and Inclusion Services for Students Statement</b>
<step>Your access in this course is important. Please send me your Disability, Access, and Inclusion (DAI) accommodation letter early in the semester so that we have adequate time to discuss and arrange your approved academic accommodations. If you have not yet established services through DAI, please contact them to engage in a confidential conversation about the process for requesting reasonable accommodations in the classroom. DAI can be reached by calling: 401-874-2098, visiting: web.uri.edu/disability, or emailing: dai@etal.uri.edu.  We are available to meet with students enrolled in Kingston as well as Providence courses.</step>
</procedure>

<procedure style="choices">
<b>Academic Enhancement Center</b>
<p>The Academic Enhancement Center (AEC) offers face-to-face and online services to undergraduate students seeking academic support. Services are based out of Roosevelt Hall, the Carothers Library room LL004, and online. Peer tutoring is available for STEM &amp;BUS-related courses through the Drop-In Center and small-group tutoring. The Writing Center peer consultants offer feedback focused on supporting undergraduate writers at any stage of a writing assignment. The UCS 160 course and one-to-one Academic Skills Consultations offer strategies for improving studying and test-taking skills. Complete details about each of these programs, up-to-date schedules, contact information, and self-service study resources are all available on the AEC website, uri.edu/aec.</p>
<step>STEM &amp; BUS Tutoring helps undergraduate students navigate a variety of 100 and 200 level STEM &amp;BUS courses through free peer tutoring in-person and online. Students can 
select occasional or weekly tutoring sessions through the TracCloud system or visit the Drop-In Center, located in the Carothers Library lower level room LL004. The TracCloud application is available through URI Microsoft 365 single sign-on and more detailed information and instructions can be found at uri.edu/aec/tutoring.</step>
<step>Academic Skills Development courses and programs teach students how to plan and apply time management and study strategies. UCS 160: Success in Higher Education is a one-credit course on strategic approaches to planning and studying. UCS 161x: Becoming a Self Directed Student teaches strategies for taking greater control over their academic work and lives.  Academic Consultations are 1 to 1 meetings that help individual students to address their academic challenges. Students can schedule in-person or online consultations with David Hayes on Starfish. Study Your Way to Success is a self-guided web portal connecting students to tips and strategies on studying and time management related topics. For information or help with scheduling, contact Dr. Hayes directly at davidhayes@uri.edu. </step>
<step>The Undergraduate Writing Center provides peer writing support to students in any class, at any stage of the writing process: from understanding an assignment and brainstorming ideas, to developing, organizing, and revising a draft. Writing consultations are available through: 1) 25- or 50-minute in-person appointments, 2) synchronous online appointments, and 3) asynchronous written feedback. Synchronous appointments hosted by WCOnline are video-based, with audio, chat, document-sharing, and live captioning capabilities, to meet a range of accessibility needs. View availability and book online at uri.mywconline.com. For more information, visit uri.edu/aec/writing.</step>
