## Support Tools & Technology

Students in this class will use edstem for communication, assignments, grading, and code development. All students are required to use their primary email from eCampus for entering edstem. We automatically register students.


## Student Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, each student will be able to:

## Deliverables

### Quizzes

Each week you will have a brief, 10-minute quiz. The quiz will consist of one of each of the following questions types: fill-in-the-blank, multiple-choice, multiple-response, interactive code.

### Labs

Labs are a practical application of the material learned each week. Labs are somewhat scaffolded throughout the term in the respect they will grow and incorporate prior weekly materials. Labs are to be completed the lab session and submitted before leaving. Credit will not be granted to submissions outside of this window.


### Assignments

A practical attempt at code spanning multiple weeks of the course. This is not meant to be difficult but merely to give some practical experience with prior concepts as the term moves forward.


### Research Project

The research project is a chance to incorporate what's been learned from the course and throughout some research completed to implement a solution (on a microscope) to a real-world, computer science problem. Groups will complete a full implementation of their project, a report, and repository.
