## Spring 2024 Syllabus {switcher-key="Spring 24"}

### Course Description

<note>
<p>CSC 212 introduces fundamental concepts in data structures and algorithms, and their role in organizing and processing information efficiently. The course explores theoretical, implementation, and application aspects of important data structures and algorithms in use on modern computers. Particular emphasis is given to algorithms for searching and sorting. The course also covers basic concepts for analyzing space and time requirements of algorithms, critical for understanding their performance characteristics. C/C++ is the programming language required for programming assignments and lab sessions.</p>
<i>Prerequisites: C- or better in CSC 211; and MTH 180 or Computer Engineering major, and understanding the basics of programming in a higher level language such as C, Java, or Python. You should be familiar with classes, objects, methods, functions, loops, conditionals, arrays.</i>

### Action Items

<procedure>
<p>Labs / Recitations</p>
<step>For the first four (4) weeks of the term, you will work on practicals during your lab section. This will provide you the opportunity to acclimate to Gradescope. After week four (4), we will begin recitations. These will be presentations of subtopics relative to an overarching theme for the week.
</step>
</procedure>

<procedure>
<p>Practicals</p>
<step>Practicals are a chance for you to show what you understand and to use what you know in a practical, hands-on way.</step>
</procedure>

<procedure>
<p>Assignment</p>
<step>A practical attempt at code spanning multiple weeks of the course. This is not meant to be difficult but merely to give some practical experience with prior concepts as the term moves forward.</step>
</procedure>

<procedure>
<p>Term Project</p>
<step>Term project incorporates the combination of all subject-matter from the course. This is used as the ultimate practical for understanding, comprehension, and overall 
ability for implementation. The project will be completed in groups of 3-4 members to be presented to the class in Week 14. </step>

<step>Academic Skills Development courses and programs teach students how to plan and apply time management and study strategies. UCS 160: Success in Higher Education is a one-credit course on strategic approaches to planning and studying. UCS 161x: Becoming a Self Directed Student teaches strategies for taking greater control over their academic work and lives.  Academic Consultations are 1 to 1 meetings that help individual students to address their academic challenges. Students can schedule in-person or online consultations with David Hayes on Starfish. Study Your Way to Success is a self-guided web portal connecting students to tips and strategies on studying and time management related topics. For information or help with scheduling, contact Dr. Hayes directly at davidhayes@uri.edu. </step>
<step>The Undergraduate Writing Center provides peer writing support to students in any class, at any stage of the writing process: from understanding an assignment and brainstorming ideas, to developing, organizing, and revising a draft. Writing consultations are available through: 1) 25- or 50-minute in-person appointments, 2) synchronous online appointments, and 3) asynchronous written feedback.
