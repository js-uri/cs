# Research Project



## Overview

You will work in groups to discover topics which have been left uncovered in the course. You will work with your group to create an informative 15-minute presentation, a dynamically programmed real-world microcosm implementation, well-defined documentation, and research paper bringing it all together.



## Requirements


### Topic

You may choose any data structure or algorithm which has not been covered in the course. All topics must be approved by your instructor.


### Presentation

<procedure style="choices">
<p>The presentation should take a lecture format. It should be:</p>
<step>informative and engaging</step>
<step>include a visual aids (such as a slideshow or whiteboard)</step>
<step>include a demonstration of the microcosm implementation</step>
<step>15 minutes in length</step>
</procedure>


### Microcosm Implementation

Based on your research, implement a real-world microcosm of your topic. This should be a dynamic program which allows the user to interact with the data structure or algorithm. The program should be well-documented and include a README file.


### Documentation

<procedure style="choices">
<p>The documentation file will hold your program's must-know information. It should include descriptions of the:</p>
<step>data structure or algorithm</step>
<step>microcosm (briefly)</step>
<step>program's functionality</step>
<step>program's usage instructions</step>
<step>program's dependencies</step>
<step>program's installation instructions</step>
</procedure>


### Research Paper

<procedure style="choices">
<p>The research paper should be the culmination of your research. The length is inconsequential as long as it is qualitative. It should include the:</p>
<step>data structure or algorithm</step>
<step>microcosm</step>
<step>program's implementation</step>
<step>program's usage</step>
<step>program's future</step>
<step>program's limitations</step>
<step>program's strengths</step>
<step>program's weaknesses</step>
<step>program's use cases</step>
</procedure>


## Groups

Will consist of 3-4 members. Each group will complete the project as required and participate in a peer review of the other groups' projects.

## Submission

All submissions will be completed through Gradescope based on the current Milestone requirements. You will submit your recorded presentation, microcosm implementation, repository link, and research paper. 

You will also submit peer reviews of the other groups' projects in Gradescope. A rubric will be provided for you to complete.

## Project Pitfalls

<procedure style="choices">
<p>Choosing a topic</p>
<step>scope is too narrow : not enough to merit a 14-week project</step>
<step>scope is too broad : too much to provide a sound summary</step>
</procedure>

<procedure style="choices">
<p>Not keeping up with</p>
<step>peers : keeping all accountable</step>
<step>timeline : tracking who's doing what, when, where</step>
<step>individual aspects : documentation, paper, microcosm, presentation, peer group</step>
</procedure>
